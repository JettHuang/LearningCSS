<!--
关于 CSS 中元素的水平对齐(Horizontal Align)，你可以使用多种属性来进行设置。
块元素对齐

块元素是一个元素，占用了全宽，前后都是换行符。
块元素的例子：
<h1>
<p>
<div>
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>水平对齐</title>
    <style>
        .center {
            margin: auto;
            width: 70%;
            background-color: #b0e0e6;
        }
        
        .right {
            position: absolute;
            /* 绝对定位与文档流无关，所以它们可以覆盖页面上的其它元素。 */
            right: 0px;
            width: 300px;
            background-color: #b0e0e6;
        }
        
        .float_right {
            float: right;
            width: 300px;
            background-color: #b0e0e6;
        }
    </style>
</head>
